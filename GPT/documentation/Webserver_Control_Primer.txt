Webserver Control Primer
========================

The local sender mirrors the Nucleares webserver''s `WEBSERVER_LIST_VARIABLES_JSON` response into the telemetry stream that the Operating Assistant can query through `/api/state`.

Where to find it
----------------
- Every state snapshot contains `_meta.webserver_catalog`.
- `_meta.webserver_catalog.post` enumerates every variable that accepts write commands.
- `_meta.webserver_catalog.get` lists the read-only variables exposed by the game webserver.

How to use it
-------------
1. Query `/api/state?flat=true` (or the relevant group) and inspect `_meta.webserver_catalog.post`.
2. Only queue commands that target variables present in that list (case-insensitive).
3. If a desired lever is missing, inform the operator that the control is not exposed via the tablet and outline the manual procedure instead.

Automation safeguards
---------------------
- The sender validates every queued task against `_meta.webserver_catalog.post` before reaching the plant. Unsupported variables produce a clear `Unsupported control variable` error.
- Pulse operations still work, provided both the active and reset variables exist in the catalog.

Tip: For quick lookups, ask the OA to "list writable variables containing PUMP". It can filter the catalog and avoid trial-and-error command attempts.
